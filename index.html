                        Git is powerful and popular version control software that is used for making collaboration on projects easy, as well as keeping detailed records of how each individual file in a project has changed over time.

                        GitHub is an online service that allows you to host your Git repositories remotely. GitHub offers both free and paid accounts which both allow you to host unlimited repositories on their site. The only differnce between free and paid accounts is that a paid account is required to keep a number of your repositories private and unable to be seen by those who haven't been added as collaborators. Below is a description of the basic workflow that you'll use when interacting with Git and GitHub.

                        The very first thing you need to do to use Git (assuuming you already have it installed) is to create a repository. This can done via the command line using the <code>git init</code> command, or through a Git/GitHub application. In either case, all you have to do is navigate to the directory where your project is stored and initialize the repository, either with the command mentioned earlier, or via the "Create" button in your Git application.

                        When you create a Git repository, by default, you'll make changes to what is known as the master branch. This is the branch from which you'll make deployments, and will often make changes to directly. However, you may be planning a new feature for your project that will cause a lot of changes that you don't necessarily want to be deployed yet. A great way to do this is to create a new branch from your master branch. Doing this allows you to make changes alongside the main project, without actually modifiying the deployable branch. This can be done in the GitHib application by navigating to the "new branch" button and following the prompts.

                        Making Commits

                    <p>
                        After you add files to your project or make changes files already in your project, you need to to tell the repository that it's time to save a record of these changes. You do this by creating what is known as a commit. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To create a commit, the first thing you need to do is stage the files that have chnaged that you wish to commit. This is most easily accomplished in the GitHub application's commit menu, in which you can simply check off which files that you want to stage. After that, all you have to do is type in the message that you want to have associated with that commit so that it can be recognized in the future and hit the commit button. Doing so will save the commit locally within the repository, so if you want to push your changes up to the server (GitHub) you must then hit the sync button.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hint: Git diffs show you the differences between your current commit and the last commit (red/green highlighting)
