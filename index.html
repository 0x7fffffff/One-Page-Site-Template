                        Git is powerful and popular version control software that is used for making collaboration on projects easy, as well as keeping detailed records of how each individual file in a project has changed over time.

                        GitHub is an online service that allows you to host your Git repositories remotely. GitHub offers both free and paid accounts which both allow you to host unlimited repositories on their site. The only differnce between free and paid accounts is that a paid account is required to keep a number of your repositories private and unable to be seen by those who haven't been added as collaborators. Below is a description of the basic workflow that you'll use when interacting with Git and GitHub.

                        The very first thing you need to do to use Git (assuuming you already have it installed) is to create a repository. This can done via the command line using the <code>git init</code> command, or through a Git/GitHub application. In either case, all you have to do is navigate to the directory where your project is stored and initialize the repository, either with the command mentioned earlier, or via the "Create" button in your Git application.

                        When you create a Git repository, by default, you'll make changes to what is known as the master branch. This is the branch from which you'll make deployments, and will often make changes to directly. However, you may be planning a new feature for your project that will cause a lot of changes that you don't necessarily want to be deployed yet. A great way to do this is to create a new branch from your master branch. Doing this allows you to make changes alongside the main project, without actually modifiying the deployable branch. This can be done in the GitHib application by navigating to the "new branch" button and following the prompts.

                    <p>
                        After you add files to your project or make changes files already in your project, you need to to tell the repository that it's time to save a record of these changes. You do this by creating what is known as a commit. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To create a commit, the first thing you need to do is stage the files that have chnaged that you wish to commit. This is most easily accomplished in the GitHub application's commit menu, in which you can simply check off which files that you want to stage. After that, all you have to do is type in the message that you want to have associated with that commit so that it can be recognized in the future and hit the commit button. Doing so will save the commit locally within the repository, so if you want to push your changes up to the server (GitHub) you must then hit the sync button.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hint: Git diffs show you the differences between your current commit and the last commit (red/green highlighting)

                    <p>
                        Now that you've made changes to your project and committed them, you're going to want to apply these changes. There are two common ways of doing this. The first to merge the branch you've created back into the master branch. This is usually useful when making changes to a repository hosted locally. Merging the branch into the master branch will bring control flow back and the repository's working head back to master. After doing so, you will no longer make commits to the branch you've created, but to the master branch instead.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        The other common workflow for applying changes is to make a pull request to the repository. This is common when working on a remotely hosted project with multiple collaborators, or an open source project of some kind. In this case, you'll navigate the the repository's branches section on GitHub and select the branch you've been working on. From there, you'll be given the option to merge the pull request back into the repository's master branch.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is very similar to the way you merge branches yourself but with one major difference. Instead of just being able to merge the branches, you have to request that it be done by the project's owners.

                    <p>
                        Once you've made all your changes and your event tree is looking good, you may want to publish a specific events in the history of the project. (v1.0, v2.0, etc.) To do this, you create a release. Creating releases are easy. All you have to do is navigate to the releases section for your repository on GitHub and click the "Create New Release" button. From there, you'll see a menu that allows you to create a release of a specified version number and title. Users will be able to download your project as it was at this point by downloading this release.

                    <p>
                        Sublime Text 2 is an extremely flexible and powerful text editor that can be used for programming in any language.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Following this guide should give you a basic understanding of some of the features of Sublime Text 2 and help you to learn how to start using it proficiently. In this training exercise I’ll be explaining how to use some of the features of Sublime Text 2 that I find most useful when using it myself. This will include features like, the side navigator, multiple selections, the command palette, templates and the find an replace menus.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This guide will assume that you already have downloaded and installed Sublime Text 2 from http://www.sublimetext.com and are comfortable with basic programming concepts. Other than that no tools will be required for this guide.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This guide will use the learn by doing training technique coupled with brief verbal descriptions of each topic when the topic requires a deeper understand than can be quickly gained from viewing the program. Guidance will be applied as necessary if the student has any additional questions or concerns about Sublime Text 2. In other situations, the student will watch me show them how to use a particular feature.
                    </p>
